# engine-dev
rocket engine design and development code

overall goal: robust codebase of scripts that may be used to perform sizing and initial design and analysis of bipropellant liquid rocket engines

# Modules
## engine_design_code
- Initial combustor sizing and heat transfer analysis

## feed_system_design_code
- Sizing of pressurant and plumbing systems 

## vehicle_design_and_trades
- 1D Trajectory Analysis to determine high level design objectives given mission targets
